# Protein Atom Search Tool

## Overview

This C program is designed for bioinformatics applications, specifically to analyze Protein Data Bank (PDB) files. The tool searches for atoms in a protein that are within a specified distance threshold from a given CA (alpha carbon) atom. The implementation of the search algorithm utilizes KD-trees for efficient spatial searching.

## Features

- **Protein Data Input:** The program takes a PDB file as input, representing the three-dimensional structure of a protein.

- **CA Atom Selection:** Users can specify a CA atom within the protein structure as the reference point for the search.

- **Distance Threshold:** The program identifies atoms in the protein that are within a user-defined distance threshold from the selected CA atom.

- **Output Results:** The results of the search are presented, including information about the atoms that satisfy the distance criterion.
